## Technical Documentation

### Types of Technical Documentation: 
1. Source Code documentation : 
```text
This type of documentation refers to the comments, notes, and other annotations that developers
 include within a project's source code. Source code documentation helps developers and other
  team members understand how code functions by providing information such as the purpose of 
  the code and the data structures and algorithms used.
```

2. Project Documentation
```text
This type of documentation includes all the materials that provide information about a project to both the development team and beyond, e.g., users, stakeholders, and others not involved in development. External documentation can include user manuals, guidelines, system requirements, API documentation, installation instructions, release notes, and other written materials that can be accessed and used without looking at the project source code.
```

### ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot can be extremely helpful when it comes to creating technical documentation:

- ChatGPT can be useful in creating both external and source code documentation material: descriptions, explanations, and examples of code, as well as user manuals, guidelines, system requirements, API documentation, installation instructions, release notes, and other written materials that can be accessed and used without looking at the project source code.
- GitHub Copilot is more helpful with generating source code documentation: FAQ, user manuals, guidelines, system requirements, API documentation, installation instructions, release notes, and other written materials that can be accessed and used without looking at the project source code.


### Source Code Documentation
- Inline Comments: These are notes that developers write directly into the code to explain the purpose or functionality of specific code blocks or functions. Comments are usually meant for other developers who might review, modify, or maintain the code in the future.
- Structured Class and Method Comments: These are comments that describe the purpose, inputs, outputs, and behavior of classes and methods in a structured format. This type of documentation is often used in object-oriented programming languages like Java and C#.

Integration to ngrx

NgRx is a reactive state management solution specifically for Angular applications. By harnessing the power of reactive programming using RxJS, it offers a predictable way to manage and maintain state. This is particularly beneficial in a collaborative environment like a task management tool, ensuring that state transitions are clear, deterministic, and maintainable.

Benefits of Using ngrx:

Centralized State: All application state is maintained in a single place, making debugging and state inspection easier.

Reactive Design: This allows the application to respond seamlessly to state changes, ensuring optimal performance and user experience.

Decoupled Architecture: Makes your application more scalable and maintainable.

Core Concepts

To grasp ngrx's efficacy, it's crucial to understand its primary components:

Store: A centralized object that holds the application state. Consider it as a "single source of truth."

Actions: Events that describe state changes. Using descriptive action names like 'ADD_TASK' or 'UPDATE_TASK_STATUS' can convey intent clearly.

Reducers: Pure functions that take the current state and an action, then return a new state. They're the only way to change state.

Effects: Side effects are inevitable in applications. Effects handle tasks like data fetching or accessing external resources without contaminating the reducers.

Implementation Guide

Setup:

Install @ngrx/store and @ngrx/effects.

Set up the application's main module to use the StoreModule and EffectsModule.

Creating Actions:

Define actions for every user interaction and side effect.

Example:

export const addTask = createAction('[Task Component] Add Task', props<{ task: Task }>());

Creating Reducers:

Write a reducer for each slice of state.

Example:

export const taskReducer = createReducer(

initialState,

on(addTask, (state, { task }) => [...state, task])

);

Effects:

Integrate effects to manage side effects.

Use the createEffect function to define an effect.

Inject Actions to listen for specific action types.

Accessing Data from the Store:

Use the store.select() method.

Best Practices

Normalized State: Keep your state flat and normalized. This reduces redundancy and ensures that a single item is updated in one place.
Selector Functions: Use selector functions for extracting specific slices of state. They can compute derived data, allowing Angular components to remain dumb.
Immutable Updates: Always return a new copy of your state from the reducers. Tools like immer can assist with this.
Handle Side Effects Cleanly: Ensure effects handle all asynchronous operations and side effects, isolating them from the components and reducers.
Use Case Scenarios

Adding a New Task:
User interaction dispatches an ADD_TASK action.

The reducer captures this action and updates the state.

Components subscribing to the store get updated task data automatically.

Updating Task Status:
A user changes the status of a task, dispatching an UPDATE_TASK_STATUS action.

An effect listens to this action, makes the required asynchronous operations (like updating a backend), and then dispatches a success or error action based on the outcome.

The reducer processes the outcome action to update the state.

Real-time Updates:
As the application is collaborative, when another user updates a task, the backend can push this change to other users.

Effects can listen to such external updates and dispatch appropriate actions to update the state.
```

### Best practice for writing technical documentation:
- Clarity and Specificity: Ensure that the documentation is clear, concise, and specific. Use simple language and avoid jargon that might confuse the reader.
- Contextual Information: Provide context for the documentation, including background information, use cases, and examples to help the reader understand the content.
- Structured Format: Organize the documentation into sections, headings, and subheadings to make it easier to navigate and find information.
- Use Cases and Examples: Include real-world use cases and examples to demonstrate how the technology or solution works in practice.
- Iterative Refinement: Continuously review and refine the documentation to ensure it remains up-to-date and relevant.
