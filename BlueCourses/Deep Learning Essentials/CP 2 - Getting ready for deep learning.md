- **PyTorch** is computational ML framework with an API written in LUA and C++.
- - Its powerful functionality saw interest from e.g. Facebook, Twitter, and Uber.
- - use of LUA was a drawback to spur wide adoption.
- - PyTorch is open-source and has a Python API, was invented in 2016 by Facebook.
- - Offers dynamic computation graphs, which are more flexible than TensorFlow's static graphs.
- - has become a favorite among researchers and practitioners.
- - Seen as relatively complex for newcomers.
- - Adoption in industry is growing.

- **TensorFlow** is a computational ML framework with an API written in C++.
- - Written in C++ and Python, it was invented in 2015 by Google.
- - GPU support is built-in, focus on fast handling of multidimensional arrays.
- - Very popular in industry, especially for production systems.

- **Keras** is a deep-learning lib that sits on top of TensorFlow, Theano or CNTK.
- - Provides a high-level, easy API inspired by Torch above these 'backends'
- - Created in 2015 by Fran√ßois Chollet, it is now part of TensorFlow.
- - Chosen as an officially high-level API for TensorFlow by Google.
- - Easy way to get started for newcomers.

### Honorable mentions
- CNTK is Microsoft's deep-learning framework (known now as Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit).
- - Offers a Python API over C++ code.
- - Microsoft recently announced that they will focus on Keras and TensorFlow.
- Caffe2 was the long-awaited successor to the original Caffe framework.
- - The second deep-learning framework to the backend by Facebook after Torch.
- - Not much in use these days (replaced by PyTorch).
- Sonnet was designed and built by DeepMind.
- - Library on top of the TensorFlow framework.
- Chainer is another Python-based deep-learning framework.
- - Supported by IBM, Intel, and Microsoft.
- - Main benefit is its flexibility, multi-GPU support, and dynamic computation graphs.
- MxNet is a deep-learning framework that is supported by Amazon.
- - R, Python, Scala, Julia, and C++ APIs are available.
- - Fast and flexible, it is used by Amazon for their AWS services.
- - Gluon as an API over Amazon     MXNet.
- - Has not found that much adoption outside existing Amazon services.
