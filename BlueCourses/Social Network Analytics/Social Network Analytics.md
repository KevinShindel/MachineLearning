## Social Network Applications
- Social networks: Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, etc.
- Relation by: friendship, follow, professional, etc.
- Applications: recommendation, fraud detection, etc.

Example of social networks analytics

| Social Network App         | Nodes         | Edges          |
|----------------------------|---------------|----------------|
| email community mining     | people        | email sent     |
| churn prediction in Telco  | people        | call made      |
| fraud detection            | companies     | transaction    |
| web community mining       | web pages     | hyperlink      | 
| research community mining  | researchers   | citation       |
| terrorist community mining | people        | communication  |
| anti-money laundering      | bank accounts | cash transfers | 

- Traditional churn prediction models treat customers as isolated entitites.
- Customers are strongly influenced by their social env in the following ways:
- - recommendations from friends
- - mouth-to-mouth publicity
- - social leader influence
- - promotional offers from operators to acquire group of friends
- - reduced tariffs for intra-operator traffic

- Call Detail Record (CDR) data:
- - enables extracting the social network between the customers of an operator
- - GBs or Tbs per day
- Edges: 
- - Uni or Bi-directional
- - Weighted?
- - SMS, voice, MMS or email?

## Social Networks for Fraud Detection
- Fraudsters: 
- - tend to cluster together
- - exchange knowledge how to commit fraud
- - use the same resources
- - often related to the same person 
- - different profiles belong to the same person (identify theft)
- Fraud examples:
- - credit card transaction fraud
- - identify theft

## Social Networks
- Nodes: 
- - Vertical, points
- - Customers (private/professional), households/families, credit cards, merchants, patients, 
    doctors, papers, authors, terrorists, web-pages.
- Edges:
- - Different kinds of relationships: e.g. friendships, call, transmission of disease, 
    followings, reference, etc.
- - Weighted based on e.g. interaction frequency importance of information exchange, intimacy, 
    emotional intensity, etc.
- - can also be directed.
- Links aggregate intensity of relationship between 2 nodes
- Examples: 
- - Person A and B call each other 3 times per day and person B and C each other a month
- - Computer A and B communicate each ms and computer B and C each hour.
- - Website publishes 5 links to web pages of website B and website B publishes only 1 link to C
