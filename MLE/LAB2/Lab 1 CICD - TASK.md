Q:  **Reflection Question: Why does refactor combine lint and format?**

A: **Refactoring commonly combines linting and formatting because:**
- They are complementary processes that improve code quality
- Linting checks for potential errors and enforces coding standards
- Formatting ensures consistent code style and readability
- Combining them ensures both the structure (lint) and appearance (format) are optimized in a single step
- It's more efficient to run these related tasks together rather than separately

Q: **Writing a test for the add_cli functionality:**

A: 
```python
from click.testing import CliRunner
from main import add_cli

def test_add_cli():
    runner = CliRunner()
    
    # Test help output
    help_result = runner.invoke(add_cli, ['--help'])
    assert help_result.exit_code == 0
    assert 'Add two numbers together' in help_result.output
    
    # Test actual addition
    result = runner.invoke(add_cli, ['1', '2'])
    assert result.exit_code == 0
    assert '3' in result.output

    # Test with negative numbers
    result = runner.invoke(add_cli, ['-1', '5'])
    assert result.exit_code == 0
    assert '4' in result.output
```

Q: **Reflection Question: How could you use this style of testing to build MLOps tools quickly?**

A: This style of testing is valuable for building MLOps tools quickly because:
1. **Fast Feedback Loop**:
2. **Comprehensive Testing**:
3. **MLOps Specific Benefits**:
4. **Development Speed**:
