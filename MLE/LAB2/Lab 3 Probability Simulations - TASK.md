Q: **What did you learn about the payoff for a regular employee vs. an investor?**

A: **Investors : `simulate_investor`:**
- Own between 25-50% of companies (higher equity stake)
- Can invest in multiple companies simultaneously (portfolio approach)
- Can spread risk across investments
- Have to invest capital (10K to10M per investment)

Q: **Why are simulations important first modeling steps?**

A: **Simulations are important first modeling steps because they:**
- Allow testing of hypotheses without real-world risk
- Help understand complex systems through simplified models
- Provide quick feedback on different scenarios and parameters
- Enable statistical analysis of outcomes
- Help identify key variables and relationships
- Are cost-effective compared to real-world experiments

Q: **Is it is wise to bet a large bet on red if you see the roulette wheel hit 10 black numbers in a row?**

A: **No, it is not wise to bet large on red after seeing 10 black numbers in a row. This is known as the "Gambler's Fallacy" - each spin is an independent event with the same 
probability regardless of previous outcomes. Past results do not influence future spins.**

Q: **Is there any behavior you could add to the roulette simulator that would improve it?  If so do it and build a portfolio project that shows your enhancement.**

A: **Some potential improvements for a roulette simulator could include:**
   - Visualizing results and patterns
   - Simulating multiple players simultaneously
   - Including different roulette variants (American, European, French)
